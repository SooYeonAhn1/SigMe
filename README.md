# SigMe

A symptom and mood tracker to optimize psychiatric care/appointments.

## Project Motivation

The public awareness of mental health has recently improved, leading to a steady increase in the number of individuals seeking psychiatric care. The barriers to acknowledging mental distress and seeking professional help are lowering, and the importance of mental health management is now widely understood.

However, individuals, particularly those new to psychiatric consultation, often find it challenging to communicate their condition fully within the limited session time, often feeling uncertain about what information to prioritize. Furthermore, relying solely on memory to recount daily symptoms can lead to the omission of crucial details, impede the objective identification of symptom patterns, and cause patients to withhold sensitive information.

This is why we developed SigMe (short for 'signal' + 'me'). Our goal is to empower patients to communicate their state more effectively by recording and presenting objective data on daily life struggles and symptoms. This application is designed to enhance communication between the physician and the patient, thereby aiding in the establishment of appropriate treatment directions.
